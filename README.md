# Pragmatic Romance

## What is this repo?

This is a repository for the Pragmatic Romance website.

I’ve been kicking around the idea for this project for about ten years. This is my first genuine attempt to establish something concrete. Although it will primarily include the codebase for the public-facing website, I intend to use this as a centralized place to store the notes, references, resources, and musings I’ve collected over the years as I’ve thought about this project.

## What is Pragmatic Romance

I don’t want to distract myself by capturing everything I want to say about Pragmatic Romance, but I did want to write something brief about the idea.

Pragmatic Romance is my attempt to chronicle my experiences with love and romance. I’d like to include a manifesto about what I mean by Pragmatic Romance and dive deeper into it through long-form essays, audio, and video content. I’d like to include a reading list of other writers and thinkers that have shaped my worldview and offer a space for others to share their experiences or comment on the ones I’ve shared.
